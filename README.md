### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


  I am an aspiring _game dev_ residing in Philippines. I love learning new stuff!
  
  I'm mostly coding using _C# and unity_ and I'm stubbornly learning about _software architecture and game design patterns_.
My other tools of the trade are: 
* Java
* Objective-C

I talk about anything dev related here: https://dev.to/wendhsz

\*I've also got myself learning a thing or two using GDevelop. It was a two day study I had fun messing around.\*
