### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


I am an aspiring _app and game dev_ residing in Philippines. I love learning new stuff! I'm mostly coding using _C# and unity_ and I'm stubbornly learning about _software architecture and game design patterns_, and currently enjoying making games for fun using _LibGDX_. 

My other tools of the trade are: 
* Java
* Objective-C
